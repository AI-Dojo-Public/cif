# TODO

- better name? 
- use jinja?
- base image will run entrypoint files for each service
- each service could have entrypoint.sh and check.sh

## WordPress

- instead of having an unchanged wp-config locally, download it in the build process from the github; maybe [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker-library/wordpress/5bbbfa8909232af10ea3fea8b80302a6041a2d04/latest/php8.0/apache/wp-config-docker.php)
